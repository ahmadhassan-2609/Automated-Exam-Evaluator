# Automated Exam Evaluator üìù

## Introduction

The Automated Exam Evaluator is a tool designed to help you evaluate exam papers quickly and efficiently. This app utilizes the Meta-Llama-3.1-405b-Instruct AI model to assess exam papers based on provided marking schemes, generating detailed report cards and a comprehensive final report.

You can access the deployed app [here](https://automated-exam-evaluator.streamlit.app/)

## How It Works

1. **Upload Exam Papers and Marking Schemes**: Upload solved exam papers and corresponding marking schemes in PDF format.
2. **Text Extraction**: The app extracts text from the PDF files using a PDF reader.
3. **Evaluation**: The AI model evaluates each exam paper, awarding marks and providing comments based on the marking scheme.
4. **Report Generation**: The app compiles individual reports into a final report, including a result table and overall analysis.
5. **Downloading Reports**: You can download the final report as a PDF file.

## Limitations

1. **Accuracy of Evaluation**: Evaluation relies on the quality of text extraction and the provided marking scheme.
2. **File Formats**: Only PDF files are supported.
3. **Assessment Criteria**: Evaluations are strictly based on the marking scheme provided.
4. **Token Limits**: Extremely lengthy documents may exceed the AI model's token limit.
5. **User Inputs**: Equal numbers of exam papers and marking schemes must be uploaded for proper evaluation.
